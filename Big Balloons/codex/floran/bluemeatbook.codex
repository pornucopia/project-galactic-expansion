1 Fire for cooking
1 Meats
Berries",

"Step 1: Tie meats up at hands and feets
Step 2: Feed meats berries (not with hands)
Step Three: Wait for meats to become blue meats (do not taste)
Step 4: Wait for blue meats to marinate (still do not taste)
5: Cook meats (big fire)
Step 6: Eat meats",

"Notes: Cooking is easier if meat is not screaming.
New meat is required if meat bursts (recommend feed old meats juice to new meats)
Eating blue meats will turn Floran into berry. Moving gets hard
Floran is berry right now. Writing hard. Tasty, though"
